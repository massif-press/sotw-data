    "description": "Kinetic shields are a common choice for personal defense among Karrakin nobles. Despite lacking features considered vital by most pilots, such as strength-augmentation, mech interface components, and protection against environmental hazards, shields have a few notable advantages over hardsuits. Most importantly, their generator packs are compact and easily concealed, enabling discreet use and providing protection with minimal impact on the userâ€™s fashion choices.",

The Blue Blood of Pangloss is impossible to reproduce without access to specific Begi flora and the secret distillation techniques of the Xenoglossary. Unless a PC has both of these, it can only ever be acquired as a limited-use reserve (at extraordinary cost). Those who steal or abuse the Blue Blood often find themselves the targets of the Stygos Grammaton.",
