Less often examined is the pervasive cultural impact of the industry that has been built – almost from scratch – to support the house’s colonial goals.</p><p>The Taraxacum has become almost synonymous in popular omnivids with the pioneer spirit of the colonial effort. The image of a heavy mech effortlessly lifting gear, vehicles, industrial equipment, and even prefabricated building components into and above the thick canopies is a symbol of Arrudyen power in distant lands. Moreover, the Taraxacum is a capable military frame prized by Karrakin commanders across the Dawnline Shore both as a mobility multiplier, and for its performance as an airborne early warning and surveillance platform in support of ground operations.</p>",
